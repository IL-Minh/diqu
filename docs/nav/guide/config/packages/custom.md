# Configuration for Custom query

If you're not using [dq-tools](https://hub.getdbt.com/infinitelambda/dq_tools) package or even [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), no problem, we're supporting a custom query directly to your data table/view.

The steps are as follows:

## 1. Prepare SQL script

Assuming we have a custom script named `incidents.sql` which is located in the current directory.

The script needs to provide the expected columns required for all modules below:

- `test_id`:
- `test_status`: status of the test: 'pass', 'warn', 'fail', 'deprecated'
- `test_title`: test's title to be shown in your module (e.g in the Jira module, `test_title` is used as issue's summary: 'ðŸŸ¡ | Warning in test: accepted_values_my_first_dbt_model_id__False__1__2.ee252c12b8 [dq-tools]')
- `check_timestamp`: test execution timestamp
- `no_of_records_scanned`: number of rows scanned
- `no_of_records_failed`: number of rows that did not pass the test
- `failed_rate`: percentage of no_of_records_failed / no_of_records_scanned (e.g `no_of_records_failed / nullif(no_of_records_scanned, 0) as failed_rate`)
- `tag_1`: your 1st test tag (e.g 'accepted_value')
- `tag_2`: your 2nd test tag (e.g `Accuracy)
- `prev_statuses`: an array of previous statuses (e.g `array_agg(test_status_emoji) within group (order by check_timestamp desc) as prev_statuses`)
- `prev_check_timestamps`: an array of previous execution times of this test (e.g `array_agg(check_timestamp) within group (order by check_timestamp desc) as prev_check_timestamps`)
- `prev_no_of_records_scanned`: an array of previous row scanned (e.g `array_agg(no_of_records_scanned) within group (order by check_timestamp desc) as prev_no_of_records_scanned`)
- `prev_no_of_records_failed`: an array of previous row failed (e.g `array_agg(no_of_records_failed) within group (order by check_timestamp desc) as prev_no_of_records_failed`)
- `priority`: your priority level for each test. This field will be used in 'order by' clause in all modules. It is recommended to use numbers to simplify the process.

Let's build your `SELECT` query:

```sql
-- incident.sql

select  'your_value' as title,
        ...

from    your_table
```

## 2. Alerting

See [JIRA Configuration](https://diqu.iflambda.com/latest/nav/guide/config/alerts/jira.html) for more details, following is a sample command:

```bash
# prepare the env vars here first
...
# run alerting
diqu alert --query-file incident.sql
```
